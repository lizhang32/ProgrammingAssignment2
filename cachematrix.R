## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special “matrix” object that can cache its inverse. 
## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special “matrix” returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse 
## from the cache. 
## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special “matrix”, which is really a list containing a function to:
## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse
## get the value of the inverse

  getinverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set,
